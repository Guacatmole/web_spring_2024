            Some video games that I like are: Halo Infinit, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Star Wars Empire at War. The thing that I like most about Halo Infinit is that the gameplay is fast paced but not so fast that you can die befor you even know you are being shot at. I like HZD because the story and worldbuliding are awsome. Star Wars Empire at War is a stratagy game and I like stratagy.

            A movie that I watched recently was 2012. 2012 is a disaster movie about a world destroying food. It is a dumb movie but very fun to watch and laugh at how redicurlis it is.
